# Supply_Chain_Analysis

The analysis was conducted using the pandas Python library on a Supply Chain dataset, utilizing the Jupyter Notebook extension in Visual Studio Code. The analysis was designed to answer various questions related to the Supply Chain dataset.

The dataset was imported into Jupyter Notebook and preprocessed to ensure that it was clean and structured in a manner that allowed for easy manipulation using pandas.

The data was then analyzed using various pandas functions to gain insights into the different aspects of the supply chain.
The answers to the diffrent questions were obtained by applying different pandas functions such as groupby, sum, mean, and count. The results were then visualized using various graphs and charts to provide a clearer picture of the data and insights obtained.

Overall, the analysis provided valuable insights into the Supply Chain dataset, helping to identify trends and patterns that can be used to optimize the supply chain processes and improve customer satisfaction.

The supply Chain is a network of production and logistics involved in producing and delivering goods to customers.
Supply chain analysis is the process of examining the various components of a supply chain to identify areas where improvements can be made to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and increase profitability. This involves analyzing the flow of goods and services, information, and finances between different entities in the supply chain, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers.

The analysis typically involves evaluating factors such as lead times, inventory levels, transportation costs, supplier performance, customer demand patterns, and production capacity. By identifying areas where the supply chain can be optimized, organizations can implement changes to improve overall performance, reduce waste, and increase customer satisfaction.

Supply chain analysis is a critical process for businesses looking to remain competitive in today's global marketplace, where supply chain management has become increasingly complex due to factors such as globalization, technology advancements, and changing consumer behavior.


# Supply Chain analysis Dataset; 

To analyze a company’s supply chain, we need data on the different stages of the supply chain, like data about sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, sales and customer demographics.
I found an ideal dataset for this task which includes data about the supply chain of a Fashion and Beauty startup. You can downlaod the dataset from this link; https://statso.io/supply-chain-analysis-case-study/
